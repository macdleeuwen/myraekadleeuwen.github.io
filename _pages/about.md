I am a PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I am advised by Tom Dougherty, Kathleen A. Creel, Alex Worsnip, and Luc Bovens. My research is on normative ethics and the ethics of technology.

My dissertation is about the role of privacy in interpersonal relationships. Some of my other current projects include a paper on algorithmic fairness a paper on methods for improving the transparency of neural networks.
