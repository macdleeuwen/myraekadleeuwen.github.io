I am a PhD student in philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I am advised by [Tom Dougherty](https://sites.google.com/site/tomdoughertyphilosophy/), [Kathleen A. Creel](https://kathleenacreel.com/), [Alex Worsnip](https://www.alexworsnip.com/), and [Luc Bovens](https://philosophy.unc.edu/people/luc-bovens/). My research is on normative ethics and the ethics of technology. Before coming to UNC, I did my undergrad in computer science and philosophy at Northeastern University. 

My dissertation is about the role of privacy in interpersonal relationships. Some of my other current projects include a paper on algorithmic fairness a paper on methods for improving the transparency of neural networks.

Outside of philosophy, I enjoy running slow half marathons, reading, gardening, and watching my cat sit on the back porch.

My name is pronounced Muh-rae-kuh Duh-lay-win.
